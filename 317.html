    <h2>QUESTION 317</h2>
    You need to store more than 1 MB of key/value pairs on a local client computer. The solution must meet the following
    requirements: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The data must persist even if the user of the computer works offline.</li>
        <li>The solution must use the least amount of development effort.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What should you use?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A. the sessionStorage API</li>
        <li>B. the File API</li>
        <li>C. the localStorage API</li>
        <li>D. cookies</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Correct Answer: C</h3>
    Explanation:
    <p>
    The read-only localStorage property allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data
    is saved across browser sessions. <br>
    localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed.</p>
