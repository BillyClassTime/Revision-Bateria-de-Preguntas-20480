    <h4>QUESTION 188</h4>

    Your company uses a third-party component that generates HTML for a website. The third-party component creates
    DIV elements that display a yellow background. <br> <br>

    The third-party component uses inline styles in the DIV elements that are inconsistent with your corporate
    standards. You must override the DIV elements in the style sheet with the corporate styles. <br> <br>

    You need to ensure that the website meets corporate standards. <br> <br>

    Which style should you use? <br>

    <xmp>
        A.
            #alldiv {  /* apply to HTML element with id="alldiv"*/
                background: blue;
                font: 12px/22px Arial, sans-serif;
            }
        B
            div p:only-child {
                background: blue;
                font: 12px/22px Arial, sans-serif;
            }

        C. 
            div {
                background: blue !important;
                font: 12px/22px Arial, sans-serif !important;
            }
        D.
            div {
                background: blue;
                font: 12px/22px Arial, sans-serif;
            }
    </xmp>


    <h4>Correct Answer: C</h4>

    Explanation/Reference: <br> <strong>
    Explanation: <br>
    CSS attempts to create a balance of power between author and user style sheets. By default, rules in an author's
    style sheet override those in a user's style sheet. <br>
    However, for balance, an "!important" declaration (the delimiter token "!" and keyword "important" follow the declaration) takes precedence over a normal declaration. Both author and user style sheets may contain
    "!important" declarations, and user "!important" rules override author "!important" rules. This CSS feature improves accessibility of documents by giving users with special requirements (large fonts, color combinations, etc.) control over presentation.
    </strong> <br>
    <xmp>
        /* From the user's style sheet */
        p { text-indent: 1em ! important }
        p { font-style: italic ! important }
        p { font-size: 18pt }

        /* From the author's style sheet */
        p { text-indent: 1.5em !important }
        p { font: normal 12pt sans-serif !important }
        p { font-size: 24pt }
    </xmp>

    Final Note:
    If you lean too heavily on the !important declaration to achieve your desired styles, you will eventually have a style sheet littered with !important styles. You will be fundamentally changing the way that page's CSS is processed. It is a lazy practice that is not good from a long-term management standpoint.
    <br>
    Use !important for testing or, in some cases, when you absolutely must override an inline style that is part of a theme or template framework. Even in those cases, use this approach sparingly and instead write clean style sheets that honor the cascade.
