    <h3>QUESTION 137</h3>
    DRAG DROP <br>
    You are creating a function by using JavaScript.<br>
    You have the following requirements:<br>
    The function must display loan amounts to the user within the following HTML element:<br>
    <xmp>
        <div id="display"></div>
    </xmp>
    The loan amount of 2100 must display in the HTML element.<br>
    All declared variables and functions must be scoped to the myApp variable.<br>
    You need to implement the function.<br>
    <p>
        How should you complete the relevant code? To answer, drag the appropriate code segments to the correct targets.
        Each tag may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or
        scroll to view content.</p>
    <br>
    NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
